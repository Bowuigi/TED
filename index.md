The Text EDitor for quick and easy automation

**TED** is a CLI text editor made in Pure Lua that is useful for automating tasks that require text editing

Features
---

- Read files
- Append to files
- Replace *patterns* (Compatible with Lua's gsub) on files
- Infinite argument support
- Compatible with cowsay, lolcat and similar

Run
---

To run TED, you need two things:
1. A CLI (Terminal) or similar
2. Lua (5.1+) or LuaJIT

To run it, type: 
```bash
lua/luajit [path to ted.lua] [arguments]
```
You can also make an alias for .bashrc or similar by typing (assuming you use luajit and bash and ted.lua is located on /home/):
```bash
alias ted="luajit ~/ted.lua"
```

Usage (assuming it is already aliased)
---

```bash
ted ((-h/-?/--help)(-a/--append)(-r/-read)(-R/--replace)) [filename (required if mode is not help)] [strings to add if mode is append or pattern to match if mode is replace] [string to replace with (if mode is replace)] [//n for whitespaces (if needed)]
```
Examples
---
Anyway, here are some of them:

First we create a file with the name example.txt that contains "hello world"
```bash
ted -a example.txt "hello world"
```
That outputs: "TED:Finished", this command is always printed at the end of the program

So now we read the content:

```bash
ted -r example.txt
```
That outputs:
hello world
TED:Finished

So now to the crazy stuff

Replacements
---

Since it works like lua's string.gsub functions, so you can find more on the lua docs

We will use the same file (example.txt)

Normal replacements

```bash
ted -R example.txt o 0
```

If we read the file like we did before we will see that the content is now "hell0 w0rld"

Moving letters in each word

```bash
ted -R example.txt "([^%s])([^%s]*)" "%2%1"
```

Reading the file, the content is now "ell0h 0rldw"

Replacing every word to whatever you want

For this one i will make a separate file named "word.txt" that contains: "hello, how are you?"

```bash
ted -R word.txt "[^%s]+" word
```

Reading the file, the content is "word, word word word?"

Very big replacements (200mb) on ted take â‰ˆ10 seconds, while most normal text editors just crash when trying to access it

This and much more can be done in ted in a fast and reliable way
