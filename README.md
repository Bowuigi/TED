# TED
TED is a simple CLI Text EDitor made in pure Lua

Useful for quick and easy automation.

Build instructions
-----
After downloading the file run or alias (Lua/luajit) (path to file) (arguments)

Usage
-----
ted (-h/-r/-w) [file (needed always except on -h)] [string to add if -w] [more strings or //n] ...

Newlines need to be in a separate argument (same command) but strings don't have almost any restrictions

Also the program doesn't add spaces between different arguments on the file

The program always writes at the end of a file
